<h2>Introduction </h2> <br>

TuffyTrack is a group project I worked on for Spring 2020 Software Development with Open Source class at California State Fullerton. The requirements were for a group of 2-3 students to make a project using Open Source Software, using existing Open Source software and code written by our group. It must use CASE tools, version control software, and include documentation.
